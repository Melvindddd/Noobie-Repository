Prototype Development
The PacePulse prototype was developed using Figma, a collaborative UI/UX design tool that supports mobile-friendly mockups and interactive prototypes without requiring code. Figma was chosen for its ease of use and most importantly free access to simulate app flows with favorable features and functions ideal for early-stage interaction design.

Design Focus
The prototype focuses on the core user flow: selecting a pace, starting a run, receiving alerts, and viewing a summary. To avoid overcomplicating the interface, non-essential features like advanced settings or smartwatch pairing were excluded from the initial version.

The user experience centers around a simple, “set-and-go” structure — minimal setup, intuitive feedback, and clear pacing data — helping runners stay consistent without cognitive overload.

Key Screens
Splash Screen – Briefly shows the PulseApp logo

Home Screen – Entry point after launching the app

Main Interface – Displays the map, start button, and recent data

Pace Setup – Lets users choose or save target pace zones

Run Session – Real-time display of pace, time, distance, and alerts

Pace Alerts – Vibrates and shows “Too Fast” or “Too Slow” on deviation

Run Summary – Post-run screen showing time, distance, and in-zone %

Pace Stats – Visual breakdown of weekly performance

Profile & Achievements – Personal records and completed goals

Prototype Main Flow
![Prototype Flow](Images/Flow.png)

Set a Pace → Start Run → Receive Pace Alerts → Finish Run → View Summary & Stats

Navigation supports reviewing achievements and pace trends

Interface highlights only what’s needed for each step which keeps runners focused

Design Rationale
The prototype intentionally excluded features like smartwatch-specific screens and advanced settings to keep testing simple and relevant. Vibration-based feedback, while part of the final concept, was not simulated in this prototype due to technical constraints in Figma. However, the design still supports future wearable integration — similar to how Strava or Garmin connect with third-party devices.
