# Project Overview
PacePulse is a smartwatch‑integrated mobile app that helps runners hold their target pace through real‑time vibration feedback—so there’s no need to keep glancing at a screen or listening for audio cues.

# Why It Exists
As a longtime runner, I (and many in my run club) found that checking a phone or watch for pace data broke flow, disrupted breathing, and sometimes felt unsafe. PacePulse solves this by turning pace deviations into subtle haptic alerts, letting runners stay focused on form and the road ahead.

# Who It’s For
Casual & performance‑minded runners who already train by pace

Competitive athletes dialing in tempo, interval, or long‑run targets

Running coaches looking for a tool their athletes can use without screens
(Beginners aren’t the primary audience; the app assumes familiarity with pace‑based training.)

# Key Features
Customizable pace zones with easy setup

Vibration‑only feedback (no beeps or pop‑ups)

Real‑time GPS tracking for accurate pace detection

Distraction‑free UI that disappears once the run starts

Multi‑platform design: built for phone today, ready for third‑party smartwatch companions tomorrow

# What Makes It Different
While many running apps shout audio cues or require constant wrist‑checks, PacePulse uses vibration alone—a quieter, more intuitive signal that keeps eyes forward and ears open to the environment.
